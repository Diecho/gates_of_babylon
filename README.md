# Gates of Babylon

_"I think you're ready to see... the Gates of Babylon!" — Dio_

## 🧠 Description

**Gates of Babylon** is a command-line program we built in class to simulate digital logic circuits using basic logic gates like AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, and XOR.

The user can build a custom logic block by connecting inputs and gates step by step, then view the final result as either a **circuit diagram** or a **truth table** showing all possible input/output combinations.

The goal of this project was to get hands-on experience with **digital logic design** and understand how complex logical operations are built from simple gates.
